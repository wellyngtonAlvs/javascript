# Node - Upload file and save it in a Database
Few steps for creating a simple HTML + NodeJS/Express + Multer + Sequelize upload file example.

### What I need ?

* SublimeText or other file editor
* NPM
* Node JS
* Express, node network app framework
* Multer, middleware for handling multipart/form-data
* Sequelize to save our file
* Local database or in a storage service ( like Amazon, Heroku and etc... )

### Installation

Download the project, and inside the main folder, just run the follow command for dependences installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Database
Follow the instructions on index.js file inside server/models folder.

### Test
In app.js file, I configurated the http PORT to 3000, you can change as you wanted, so, in this example, when start this example, it will be released in localhost:3000 address :)

You can check if your encode/decode image to bit is working by accessing localhost:3000/gallery ;)

So, open your favorite Terminal and run these command.
```sh
$ node app
```
